# [Part 1: eFarmony Data Structures](id:pt1)
[Back to Home](https://github.com/bgando/JS102)

In this section we will be setting up the data structures that we will be using throughout the project. We will be creating and nesting objects in arrays to reinforce concepts we learned in lecture.

**You will be placing all your code into the scripts.js file for Part 1.**

### [Step 1: Animal User Model](id:model) 
This object will be the model of a single animal user. Extra points if you get the pun in the last sentence.

##### Step 1A - Object
Create an object to hold our data model.

- Create a variable, name it `animal`, and assign it an object literal.

With Dot Notation…

- Add a property called `'username'` and assign it a value.
- Ensure that your username property exists in animal.

With Bracket Notation…

- Add a property called tagline and give it a value.
- Check that your property exists in the animal object.
- Add a property called noises and give it a value of null.
- Inspect your handiwork! Your object should look something like this:
``` 
  { username: 'daffy duck', tagline: 'Afflack', noises: null }
  ```
